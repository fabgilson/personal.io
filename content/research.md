Here are a few publications linked to both my current projects, followed by my older work while doing my PhD.

You can find most of preprints / personal copies on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fabian_Gilson), or contact me if you need more.

## Model-Driven for Agile Software Development (MDE4ASD)

This project is about bringing more modelling practices into agile software development. We look into generating models from textual documents (_e.g.,_ user stories) for further analysis, or extracting information from discussions on messaging apps. Here's a list of the publications in that area.

## Software Engineering Education

This group of works are looking into how to improve the teaching an learning of software engineering practices in the large. We looked over how to teach about usability in software language engineering and code quality assurance (mostly related to technical debt).

## Communication channel and developer knowledge

Some work I'm doing with one of my PhD student on communication channels and knowledge retrieval, moslty the work of [Camila Costa Silva](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Camila_Mariane_Silva).

Costa Silva, C, Galster, M., Gilson, F. (2021). Topic modeling in software engineering research. _In Empir Software Eng 26_, 120. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10664-021-10026-0)

## Older stuff (reverse-chronological order)

Mostly some works I've done during my PhD (software architecture and model-driven and transformations stuff), side projects (Internet of Things) and post doc (web-based system called [WebDeb](https://webdeb.be) to trace argumentation and discourse analysis).
