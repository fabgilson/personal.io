Here are a few publications linked to both my current projects, followed by my older work while doing my PhD.

You can find most of preprints / personal copies on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fabian_Gilson)

## Model-Driven for Agile Software Development (MDE4ASD)

This project is about bringing more modelling practices into agile software development. We look into generating models from textual documents (*e.g.,* user stories) for further analysis, or extracting information from discussions on messaging apps. Here's a list of the publications in that area.

* Gilson, F., Galster, M., & Georis, F. (2020). Generating Use Case Scenarios from User Stories. *In Proc. of the 2020 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software and System Processes (ICSSP)* (pp. 31–40). ACM. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1145/3379177.3388895)

## Software Engineering Education

This group of works are looking into how to improve the teaching an learning of softwaare engineering practices in the large. We looked over how to teach about usability in software language engineering and code quality asurance (mostly related to technical debt).

* Gilson, F., Morales, M., & Mathews, M. (2020). How Junior Developers Deal with Their Technical Debt?. *In Proc. of 2020 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Technical Debt (TechDebt)* (pp. 51–61). ACM. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1145/3387906.3388624)

## Communication channel and developer knowledge

Some work I'm doing with one of my PhD student on communication channels and knowledge retrieval, moslty the work of [Camila Costa Silva](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Camila_Mariane_Silva).

Costa Silva, C., Gilson, F., & Galster, M. (2019). Comparison Framework for Team-Based Communication Channels. *In Product-Focused Software Process Improvement (PROFES)* (pp. 315–322). Springer International Publishing. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-35333-9_22)


## Older stuff (reverse-chronological order)

Mostly some works I've done during my PhD (software architecture and model-driven and transformations stuff), side projects (Internet of Things) and post doc (web-based system called [WebDeb](https://webdeb.be) to trace argumentation and discourse analysis).
