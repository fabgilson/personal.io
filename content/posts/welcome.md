I've finally set up a personal website to sort all of my research and teaching material.

I'll try to publish some posts regularly. In the meantime, you can check out my [research]({{< ref "research.md" >}}) and [courses]({{< ref "courses.md" >}}) sections.

I don't think it's necessary to say that these posts reflect my own opinion and blah blah blah...

You can have a bit more info about [who I am]({{< ref "about.md" >}}).

Thanks for passing by!
