I've finally set up a personal website to sort all of my research and teaching material.

I'll try to publish some posts regularly. In the meantime, you can check out my [research]({{< ref "research.md" >}}) and [courses]({{< ref "courses.md" >}}) sections. 

You can have a bit more info about [who I am]({{< ref "about.md" >}}).
