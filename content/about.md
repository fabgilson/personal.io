## Bio

I'm a senior lecturer above the bar (assoc. prof. in Northern American system) at the [University of Canterbury](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz) in the [Computer Science and Software Engineering](https://csse.canterbury.ac.nz/) department (Aotearoa New Zealand). I'm also a member and _Industry Liaison officer_ for [Software Innovation NZ](https://softwareinnovation.nz), a network of academics in computer science and software engineering.

I graduated with a Master Degree in Computer Science at the [University of Namur](https://www.unamur.be/en/) (Belgium) in 2005. I spent a couple of years in the industry as a software developer, working for a consulting company. I then worked as a teaching assistant, doing my PhD studies part-time and graduated in 2015. I spent three years as a post-doctoral researcher and assistant lecturer at the University of Namur working on an interdisciplinary project that lead to the [WebDeb](https://webdeb.be) platform, an education tool for public debates and argumentation. I then have been appointed lecturer at the University of Canterbury in 2017. I serve as regular reviewer in international journals (e.g., _Journal of Systems and Software_, _Computers in Industry_, _Empirical Software Engineering_) and international workshops and conferences (e.g., _ECSA_, _ICSA_, _XP_, _ICSME_).

## Research

My research aims at bridging machine learning and natural language processing techniques on the one hand and agile software development practices on the other hand. My current projects include approaches to generate models from user stories, extract design decisions from chat-based communication and improve the management of software quality assurance (i.e. testing and code metrics in a DevOps context). I'm also active into enhancing the teaching and learning of software and model-driven engineering (including software language engineering) through evidence-based teaching.

My prior work focused on model transformations and how to trace requirements back into software architecture models for which a set of domain specific languages were implemented into the Eclipse EMF ecosystem.

## Industry

On top of a prior experience within the consulting industry, I used to be the [final year projects](https://www.csse.canterbury.ac.nz/seng/showcase402/) coordinator at the department of Computer Science and Software Engineering. I'm the chair of the department Marketing and Outreach Committee, so I'm in regular contact with many industries, both Christchurch-based and New Zealand-wide.
