## Bio

I'm a senior lecturer (assoc. prof. in North American system) at the [University of Canterbury](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz) in the [Computer Science and Software Engineering](https://csse.canterbury.ac.nz/) department (New Zealand). I'm also a member and _Industry Liaison_ for [Software Innovation NZ](https://softwareinnovation.nz), a network of academics in computer science and software engineering.

I graduated with a Master Degree in Computer Science at the [University of Namur](https://www.unamur.be/en/) (Belgium) in 2005. I spent a couple of years in the industry as a software developer and analyst, working for a consulting company. I then worked as a teaching assistant, doing my PhD studies part time and graduated in 2015. I spent three years as a post-doctoral researcher and assistant lecturer at the University of Namur before being appointed lecturer at the University of Canterbury in 2017. I serve as regular reviewer in international journals (e.g., _Information Systems_, _Information and Software Technology_, _Computers in Industry_) and international workshops and conferences (e.g., _ECSA_, _ICSA_, _TechDebt_).

## Research

My research aims at bridging machine learning techniques and agile software development practices. My current projects include approaches to (collaboratively) generate models from user stories (_i.e._ natural language descriptions), extract design decisions from chat-based communication, improving the management of technical debt with architecture-level metrics. I'm also active into enhancing the teaching and learning of software and model-driven engineering (including software language engineering) through evidence-based research and teaching.

My prior works focused on model transformations and how to trace requirements back into software architecture models for which a set of domain specific languages were implemented in the Eclipse EMF ecosystem.

## Industry

On top of a prior experience within the consulting industry, as [final year projects](https://www.csse.canterbury.ac.nz/seng/showcase402/) coordinator at the department of Computer Science and Software Engineering at the University of Canterbury, I'm also in contact with many industries, both Christchurch-based and New Zealand-wide, to support them with time-bound research projects involving final year software students meant to explore innovative solutions and develop proof-of-concepts influencing their tomorrowâ€™s software products.
